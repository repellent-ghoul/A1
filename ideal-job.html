<h2>My interest in the job</h2>
<p>
  Flaim systems are looking for an experienced XR developer to develop real world applications.
  They create virtual environments that mimic real world situations for the purpose of training people.
  I love gaming and I think the use of this technology in the training space is a very exciting concept.
  The use of a modified Microsoft hololens in the military is what initially sparked my interest in mixed reality.
  I would like to explore this research and development further and potentially work in developing these types
  of applications.
</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>
  Being a senior role they want someone with a lot of experience. The degree doesn't seem to be necessary
  if the applicant has the relevant experience and portfolio of previous projects they have worked on.
  They obviously develop their apps in Unity because they have focused on finding someone who has knowledge
  and experience with Unity engine and the C# language (which is used in Unity) They also want someone who has
  worked with extended reality(XR). They also require someone who has completed and released a commercial product.
  The ability to work without supervision, a passion for this particular kind of work, good communications skills,
  able to produce within reasonable time frames.
</p>

<h2>My Expereience</h2>

<p>
  I have 10+ years working in customer service with 4 years in managerial/supervisor roles.
  Below is a list of some skills I have acquired over the years.
    <p>• Excellent documentation skills and ability to communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences</P>

    <p>• Software Troubleshooting & Problem Solving.</p>
    <p>• Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work/learn as part of a team in a challenging and fast paced environment</p>
    <p>• Excellent customer service in face-to-face, telephone or electronic interaction with clients, good language and communications skills</p>
    <p>• Proficient in Windows & Mac OS operating systems</p>
    <p>• Hardware installation and software deployment</p>

</p>

<h2>My Road Map</h2>
<h4>How I plan to gain the skills required.</h4>
<p>
   I would spend more time using Unity to develop more games and become a more proficient programmer.
   I would like to invest in a VR headset and even a Microsoft Hololens one day so I can develop these projects
   in my spare time. If I could put together a portfolio of the work I have created it would be a good step
   in the right direction to getting a job in the field.
