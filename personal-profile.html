<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<h2>Test 1: 16 Personalities</h2>

<img src="images\16personalities.jpg" >

<h3>My Take</h3>

<p>
  I found this test to be the most comprehensive and the results were surprisingly accurate.
  The strengths were pretty accurate and I related to a lot of what it said. I’m empathetic and hate
  the idea of hurting anyone. I can be generous and want to share the good things with the people closest to me.
  I’m open minded and will never judge anyone on their beliefs or lifestyle. I’ve always been interested in art, from being a professional musician to painting in my spare time. I’m very passionate about ideas that capture my imagination. Idealistic in the sense that I always try to do the right thing. I always try my best to contribute to society even if it's only in a small way.
  My weakness, although hard to swallow, did ring true.
  I can be unrealistic in my expectations which can leave me feeling disappointment when things fall short.
  I can be reluctant in putting myself out there and making new friends. I can tend to be unfocused and find
  it hard to structure my ideas. I can absorb other people's negative moods or attitudes which affect my mood.
  It can bother me if someone dislikes me and I'll often try and fix the issue. Lasty, and the one that stands out
  the most for me is being self-critical. I can have unrealistic expectations for myself and when I don't live up
  to them it can cause me to abandon the project or idea completely.

<h2>Test 2: Learning Style</h2>
<h3>Solitary Learning Style</h3>

<p>
  You're a solitary learner!<br>
  <br>You prefer to work alone and use self-study to learn new material.
  You like to focus your thoughts on the material you are learning and like to assess your thoughts, strengths and weaknesses.<br>
    <br>Solitary learners should:<br>
    <br>• Set your goals and plans and understand the reason for each goal. Align your goals with your personal beliefs and values.<br>
    <br>• Create a personal interest in your topics.<br>
    <br>• Reflect on personal experiences and feelings in relation to what you are studying. This can help you remember the content and enables faster recall.<br>
    <br>• Create a study space without noise, distraction and interruptions. You tend to be most productive when nothing interferes with your concentration.<br>
    <br>• Keep a journal alongside your materials to help you clarify ideas and concepts. You can use the journal to document your feelings and observations. This may help you find meaning in the work you are studying. If you are open to exchanging ideas online, publishing a web journal may be beneficial.<br>
    <br>• Keep a portfolio – this allows you to reflect on and critique your previous work. Include a self-assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of your work. This will provide insight on areas you can improve on.<br>
</p>

<h3>My Take</h3>
<p>I don't 100% agree with the results here as I believe depending on the material I'm learning, it can dictate whether or not I would like to do it alone or with other people. I really like to bounce ideas off people and get feedback when it's in a creative environment. I think the tips and advice could be useful for anyone currently studying.

<h3>My Take</h3>

<p>
  The results here are similar to the 16 personalities test. I was surprised with how extreme factor 1 was.
  The rest seem pretty inline with the other tests. Perhaps I was in denial with my introverted personality traits.
  There is some stigma around introverted people and maybe that the problem.
</p>

<h3>What The Results Mean To Me</h3>

<p>
  I thought the results were pretty informative and gave a lot of insight into my personality and traits.
  Having a busy lifestyle, you don't really get the chance to reflect on your own personality or traits so I found
  it enjoyable to read, even though it did highlight a lot of my weaknesses.
  I think these tests can shed some light into one's personality, however I also think the results can be vague
  and relatable to just about everyone. It has definitely given me time to reflect on myself and given me better
  insight into how my personality might influence my behaviour in a team environment.
</p>

<h3>How Will these Results Influence My Behaviour In A Team</h3>

<p>
  It has made me reflect on certain aspects I recognise in myself and created more awareness of the way I behave.
  Perhaps when I recognise certain traits (in action) I'll take note of it and try to correct any negative behaviours.
  It will also make me reinforce positive behaviours I can display.
  Mediators value input from everyone and encourage people to share their ideas. I think this is a
  great benefit to any team.
</p>

<h3>How I will Use This Information When Forming A Team</h3>

<p>
  With the information I've learnt from the tests, Ideally I would want to form a team full
  of people that complement each other's personalities, traits and learning styles.
  That would be nice, but in the real world you generally don't get to choose your colleagues
  or team members. I think all I can do is use the info I've gained about myself and adapt to whatever
  team environment I may find myself in.
