<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Ice Scream is a 2D platformer developed with Unity. The game is focused around our main protagonist,
  a frightened ice cream who was accidentally dropped by the local ice cream man and now needs to make it
  back to the fridge before he melts. The world is a very hostile place for our poor little ice cream.
  The hot sun is beaming down towards earth and is rapidly melting our hero. In order to survive they must
  navigate through the environment by conquering increasingly difficult obstacles. They also have to contend
  with the hungry neighbourhood children and their vicious dogs, who want nothing more than to eat him up.
  During this journey they will meet other weird and wonderful characters that could help or hinder our heroes
  journey back to the safety of the fridge.
</p>
<p>
  Given the scope of the project, I think a realistic goal would be to achieve a playable demo or alpha build
  rather than a fully developed game that is ready to ship. Demonstrating the games core mechanics and features
  on a smaller scale. Due to time constraints and our overall skill level, I think this would be the best approach.
  Free assets are available for the Unity asset store, making development much faster.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
  I love video games and it’s always been a goal of mine to develop one from the ground up.
  It's amazing to see technology come together to create amazing works of art.
  I can't think of a more exciting and entertaining way to develop skills as a programmer or
  artist than to develop a game. The skills you could learn from developing a game could also be interchangeable
  within the industry. Such as programming, time management, team work etc.
</p>
<p>
  Troncoso (May 2021, para 10) mentions in a recent article posted on Dynamic Business,<br>
  <br>
  “Australia’s gaming industry was one of the few industries that managed to find success during the pandemic,
  growing to $3.4 billion in 2020 – around a 6 per cent jump from the year prior.”<br>
  Gaming is bigger than it's ever been and ultimately I think game development would be the most rewarding, fun
  and visually pleasing way to learn how to code.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The main feature of the game would be that it is a 2D platformer. The Player would move from point A to Point B
  to progress to the level. The player would control the characters movements through the level, avoiding hazards
  and obstacles with the goal of reaching safety before you melt! The levels would have puzzle-like elements that
  become harder as you progress to keep them interesting and challenging. The main element of danger would be from
  the sun’s rays. Whenever the character is in direct sunlight, it will damage the player's health. Too much sun and the player will die. That's where shade comes in. Shade would play a big part in the game's mechanics as it would be the only place the player could stand without taking damage from the sun. Shaded areas would be limited to keep the level challenging.
Along with the dangers, there would also be elements in the game that would help the player achieve his goal.
For example, collecting ice cubes would slow down the melting mechanic by replenishing the player's health and
liquid chocolate would form a protective helmet that would protect the character from the sun's rays or other hazards
</p>

<p>
  The art style would be colourful and vibrant. The world is filled with bizarre and wonderful characters.
  Below is a rough sketch of the main characters. Giving a good indication of the art style I am trying to achieve.

<h2>Tools And Technologies</h2>

<p>
  <b>Unity Editor <br></b>
  Unity Editor is the game development software. The engine will be used to create a 2D game.
  Unity is free when you create a personal or small business account as long as you are not generating
  over $100,000 annually.
</p>

<p>
  <b>PC <br></b>
  The minimum system requirements are not very demanding, however the performance and rendering will rely on your
  hardware so the better it is the better the smoother the experience.
</p>

<p>
  <b>IDE</b> <br>
  A IDE for creating scripts. I recommend VS code which is free and has the following useful features:
  Support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Recording DAW</b> <br>
A digital audio workstation to record sound effects and voice overs.
There are lots of free options out there like garageband.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Microphones</b> <br>
  A good condenser microphone for recording dynamic sounds.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Painting program</b> <br>
  Krita is a free open source program that can be used to design artwork for the game.
</p>

<h2>Skill Required</h2>

<p>
  Because the project is focused on developing a demo, rather than a complete game, I believe with a lot of hard work it could be achieved. A few rough edges are to be expected and usually forgiven in an alpha build and those things can be refined later on.
  I already own all the equipment and hardware required to start this project. The biggest hurdle would be time restraints and lack of game development experience. I’ve outlined below what would be required to get the project off the ground.
</p>

<p>
  The first skill required would be the ability to use Unity Editor. The bulk of the workload would be done in unity so familiarity with the program is a must. Unity has become very popular in the last few years and more and more people are using it.
</p>

<p>
  A basic understanding of C# would be helpful as Unity’s scripts are written in C#. However,
  Unity’s asset store has so many free assets available. I honestly think the game could be created with very minimal coding. Assets like player controllers scripts and art packs are readily available for free on the asset store
</p>

<p>
  I have an art style in mind although, the technical ability and resources may be lacking to achieve a professional looking product. However, being an alpha build, I'm not too concerned with the overall look. I want to focus on the game mechanics and make the game feel as enjoyable as possible. Once all the game mechanics are polished and working well the art work would become the main focus. Placeholder art work could be used during development to speed up the process.
</p>

<p>
  Music production software would also be required if the games music and sound effects were to be created. Otherwise there are free music and sound effects available online.
</p>

<p>
  Writing would also be a desirable skill. A strong narrative would help draw the player in and make them want to explore the world.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>

<p>
  If the project is successful it would lay the groundwork for what could potentially be a fully developed game. The outcome would be a fully functioning 2D platformer game demo with all the game mechanics and features working smoothly. Giving the player a good insight into the direction the game is heading. I hope that this would have a positive impact on my understanding of game development. It could also be very eye opening and expose me to the amount of work and effort required to develop a game in 2 dimensions. My ideal job is to create 3D applications in AR/VR and this project would be a step in the right direction. I also see the project as a very interactive and exciting way to learn.
