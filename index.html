<h2> About me</h2>
<p>
  I was born in Shepparton. A country town 180km northeast of Melbourne.
  Shepparton is part of the Goulburn valley and is known for its surrounding orchards and dairy farming. It is also home to the food manufacturer SPC
  I come from an Italian background. Which means my love of pizza is strong.
  I have been a gamer since I was a child and still continue to enjoy games now.
  I’ve also been a musician most of my life and played professionally for a number of years.
  Mostly Spanish/latin inspired music but also played in metal and rock bands.
  I’ve included a picture of Emily(my partner) and myself on our 2018 holiday in Mexico.
  I like to take holiday photos on an old film camera I have (hence the grainy quality of the picture).
  I really enjoy the look of film and it's the one piece of technology in my life that I refuse to upgrade &#128516
</p>

<h2>Why IT?</h2>
<p>
  My interest in IT began when we got our first family computer. I can't remember the hardware specs
  but I remember it was running windows 95 and we had a copy of Microsoft Dangerous Creatures.
  My sister and I would spend hours using the program to learn about all the dangerous creatures in the world.
  There was also a dialogue driven story game that I really enjoyed and that game ignited my passion for video games.
  Being a gamer has kept me interested in technology and all the latest tech.
  In my current and previous jobs, I have always been the unofficial tech support.
  I enjoy troubleshooting problems and find it really rewarding once a solution has been discovered.
  My main motivation for taking this course would be so that I can land an entry level job in a
  technical support specialist role. This would be my way into the industry so that I can gain experience
  and then work towards a development role. I find extended reality(XR) fascinating and would love to discover
  more about it.
</p>

<h2>Why RMIT?</h2>
<p>
  I’ve always been interested in the development of apps for AR/VR and use of them in the workplace or education.
  When I saw an article about how RMIT had partnered with Microsoft to develop a course focused on games and graphics
  programming for mixed reality designers and programers it really got me thinking about going back to study.
  The opportunity to work with hardware like the hololens is something I’d one day like to do.
  I think it's exciting to be surrounded by like minded people who share the same interests as me and be inspired
  even more so by the world of IT. Collaborate with others on interesting, fun and exciting projects.
</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>
  I expect to learn the fundamentals of IT and the ways to to begin a career within the industry.
  Also better insight into what jobs are out there. I feel like while I know a lot of the common jobs
  available for IT professionals, there are a ton I wouldn't have even thought about. I’m hoping this
  course will give me a clearer idea of what's available out there and develop my skills accordingly.
